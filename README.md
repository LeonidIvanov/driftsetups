# <a href="https://driftsetup.com">DriftSetups</a>
This project is one of my Django pets. Basically, it's a platform where drift car owners can create their setups and give/get advice about its build.
Users have an ability to log in through googe+, facebook or email.
Also, it has ru/en localization performed by i18n.
